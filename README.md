# Samples-python-helloworld

This is a simple hello world example to show a Python connection to InterSystems IRIS. 
It stored data natively into your instance of InterSystems IRIS. 


## Run the sample

In the integrated terminal window type: 

* `cd /home/project/Samples-python-helloworld`  
* `pip install wheel/irisnative-1.0.0-cp34-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl`
* `python hello_world.py`

From Management Portal, switch to USER namespace. Choose **System Explorer** > **Globals** to verify the `^testglobal` was created.
